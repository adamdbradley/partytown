# Party Town üéâ

> A fun place for your third-party scripts to hang out

‚ö†Ô∏è Warning! This is experimental! ‚ö†Ô∏è

- Relocates resource intensive scripts to into a [web worker](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Workers_API)
- Web worker DOM implementation within `4kb`
- Throttled 3rd-party code by using one `requestAnimationFrame()` per DOM operation, reducing jank
- Debug what 3rd-party scripts are calling into
- Sandbox specific browser APIs
- Main thread performance is, without question, more important than web worker thread performance

### Goals

- Free up main thread resources to be used only for the primary webapp execution
- Reduce layout thrashing coming from 3rd-party scripts
- Isolate 3rd-party scripts within a sandbox (web worker](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Workers_API)) to give better insight as to what the scripts are doing
- Configure which browser APIs specific scripts can, and cannot, execute
- Webapp startup time unchanged when Party Town library is added
- Opt-in only, and does not automatically update existing scripts
- Allow 3rd-party scripts to run exactly how they're coded and without any alterations
- Read and write main thread DOM operations _synchronously_ from within a web worker
- No build-steps or bundling required, but rather update scripts the same as traditional 3rd-party scripts are updated

### Trade-offs

- Party Town library scripts must be hosted from the same origin as the HTML document (not a CDN)
- DOM operations within the worker are purposely throttled, slowing down worker execution
- Not ideal for scripts that are required to block the main document (blocking is bad)
- Service worker network requests (even though they're all intercepted, not actual external HTTP requests, and do not affect [Lighthouse scores](https://web.dev/performance-scoring/), many service worker network requests still show up in the network tab)
- Party Town library initially has two HTTP requests on the first load, then only one HTTP request after that

### Browser Feature Requirements

- [ES Modules](https://caniuse.com/es6-module)
- [Service Workers](https://caniuse.com/serviceworkers)
- [JS Proxies](https://caniuse.com/proxy)
- [Reflect](https://caniuse.com/mdn-javascript_builtins_reflect)

## Party Town Library Scripts

For each 3rd-party script that should not run in the main thread, but instead party üéâ in a web worker, its script element
should set the `type` attribute to `text/plain`, and set the `data-partytown` attribute. This does two things:

1. Prevents the script from executing on the main thread.
2. Provides an attribute selector for the Party Town library.

```html
<script type="text/plain" data-partytown>
  // 3rd-party analytics scripts
</script>
```

The Party Town library should be added to the bottom of the page and have both the
`type="module"` and `async` attributes. The `type="module"` attribute ensures the library is
loaded as an [ES module](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Modules),
and the [async](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/script#attr-async)
attribute tells the browser this not a critical resource.

```html
<script src="/~partytown/partytown.js" type="module" async></script>
```

Note that this script _must_ be hosted from the same origin as
the HTML page, rather than a CDN. Additionally, the Party Town library scripts should be
hosted from their own dedicated root directory, such as `/~partytown/`. This root directory
becomes the [scope](https://developers.google.com/web/ilt/pwa/introduction-to-service-worker#registration_and_scope)
for the service worker, and all client-side requests within that path
are intercepted by Party Town.

With scripts disabled from executing, the Party Town library can lazily begin loading and
executing the scripts from inside a worker.

## Distribution

The distribution comes with two builds:

### `partytown.js`

- Single-file with the worker script inlined so there is only one request
- Minified and property renamed
- Console logs removed

### `partytown.debug.js`

- Fires a second network request for the web worker at `partytown.debug.worker.js`
- Not meant for production, but useful to inspect what scripts are up to
- Readable property names
- Opt-in for additional console logs using attributes on the script element:
  - `debug-property-getters`: Log every browser API property getter
  - `debug-property-setters`: Log every browser API property setter
  - `debug-method-calls`: Log every browser API method call
  - `debug-define-methods`: Log all of the browser API methods that were defined
  - `debug-define-properties`: Log all of the browser API properties that were defined

Example script with a debug attribute to print out more logs.

```html
<script src="/partytown.debug.js" debug-method-calls async></script>
```

### Worker Instances

By default all Party Town scripts will load in the same worker. However, each
script could placed in their own named web worker, or separated into  
groups by giving the script a `data-worker` attribute.

```html
<script type="text/plain" data-partytown data-worker="GTM">
  // Google Tag Manager
</script>

<script type="text/plain" data-partytown data-worker="GA">
  // Google Analytics
</script>
```

By placing each script in their own worker it may be easier to separate and debug
what each script is executing. However, in production it may be preferred to always
share one worker.

## Development

```
npm install
npm run dev
```

Note that during development, the build of `partytown.js` is not minified.

### Integration Tests

Tests to be ran on a browser are located in the `tests`. First start the server, then visit http://localhost:4000/tests/

```
npm run serve
```

http://localhost:4000/tests/

### Unit Tests

```
npm test
```

```
npm run test.watch
npm run test.watch -- /path/to/test.unit.ts
```
